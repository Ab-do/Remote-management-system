**RMS**

**RMS** is a configurable remote management system that allows you to control a farm via a mobile application or an SMS with a notification system to see the status of each component on the farm as well as a central unit to centralize all farm data and see the history of each component (pumps, valves, etc.).
There is also the possibility of making relationships between components or automating an action (eg starting a pump.)
